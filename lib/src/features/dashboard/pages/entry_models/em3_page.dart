<p>This is the entry model based on indicator Fixed Volume Range Profile. <br><br>
In the chart we have mark down different key levels of volume the POC, VaH, VaL level. 
<br>
We have marked the price is being rejected once from the VaH and PoC level work as a support zone. 
After again the rejection tools place in the VaH area which forms a doji candle and a liquidity swept of previous VaH candle which gives a clear confirmation that the sellers are more strong.
<br>
<br>
By this mentality we took a trade from the doji candle and the TP to the PoC level because we didnâ€™t knew how the PoC level reacts when the price arrives there. 
<br>
<br>
By this technique or marking other key levels rejection on PoC level or VaL area can be the good way to confirm the market continuation or market reversal.
